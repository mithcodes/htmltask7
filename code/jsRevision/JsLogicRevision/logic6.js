let a=5;
var b=6;
console.log(this.b);

console.log(window.b)

console.log(window.a) //This line logs the value of window.a. However, a was declared using let, and let does not attach variables to the global object. So, it logs undefined.

console.log(this.a);// In this case, it logs undefined because a was declared using let, and it is not attached to the global object.

//In JavaScript, when you declare a variable using let or const, you cannot declare it again in the same scope. This is because let and const introduce block-scoped variables, and re-declaring a variable in the same scope is not allowed.
